                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Through competing in robotics for over 8 years I have developed many soft and hard skills. Most notably I have worked extensively in teams of all sizes,
                    and backgrounds. Ranging from experts working together at the world championships or beginners holding a spanner for the first time. Furthermore, as a club
                    leader of the Otumoetai Robotics club I was able to develop skills in conflict resolution and large project oversight.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Additionally, robotics vastly improved my knowledge of software, hardware design and system integration. Allowing me to learn the C/C++ programming language,
                    usage and creation of API software, and best practices regarding documentation and version control. In addition to this, I was able to develop strong mechanical
                    fundamentals through building and iterating on designs. My communication of these ideas and processes was then refined by my volunteer work with The House of 
                    Science (a science education group) and many local schools in Tauranga and Palmerston North.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Finally, when competing in these events it is a high stress, high speed environment. This has instilled a strong sense of dedication and determination as pillars
                    of my personality. If a solution is not immediately presented, I will get down to work by myself or with a team to find the best way forward.

                                In the third year of my mechatronics degree, teams were presented with the problem
                                of creating an autonomous robot to navigate a room. My team decided to use two 
                                control boards, to achieve two goals. The first board, a Nucleo f303k8, was programmed 
                                to communicate with the hardware directly, using a custom pure pursuit algorithm and 
                                encoder/gyroscope odometery to position the robot. The second board, a Raspberry Pi,
                                was programmed with a custom Real Time Operating System to receive data from a LiDAR
                                and user (over Wi-Fi) to inform its overall path. The mother board (Raspberry Pi), is 
                                in constant communication with daughter board to give movement instructions and verify
                                position data with the absolute position, calculated from the LiDAR. This project also
                                allowed me to create Windows and Android applications (C#), for the user to see the status 
                                of the robot and give instructions.

                                In the second year of my mechatronics degree, teams were tasked with creating a
                                coil winding system from scratch. My team decided to create an open bed model,
                                to allow quick and easy prototyping or component replacement. This project required
                                me to create a coil winding and serial communication program in C++ for use on a 
                                STM32 FR446RE microcontroller. By using stepper motors and a tensioning system, 
                                a simple velocity PID could be implemented to maintain the speed between the input
                                and output coils. In addition, I created a windows application using C# for the user
                                to interface with, focusing on an intuitive and easy layout. These settings would
                                then be sent via UART serial to the microcontroller and applied.

                                During the summer of 2020 I was able to work with Zespri to create a kiwifruit recognition
                                system. Initially it was thought that artificial intelligence would be the best solution,
                                this proved to be accurate in ideal situations, but failed under low light. A colour analysis
                                algorithm would object permanence was then tested to give better results in all cases tested.
                                Finally, I created some C++ code to turn the Time-of-Flight camera data into a 3d model, which
                                could then be analysed using a custom plugin for blender, which was then returned and matched
                                back to the regular camera data for exact edge detection. This is then presented to the user
                                in a C# application.

                                In my time competing I was able to make it to the world championships in America three times, after winning the national
                                championships here in New Zealand against 70+ other teams for three consecutive years. At the world championships 
                                the best we achieved was a semifinals elimination and a design notebook award (on separate years). At the national
                                competition we received the design notebook award, an award for the best design process and documentation. The 
                                following year we received the highest award possible, the excellence award, for the best overall team, design, 
                                programming and design.

                                2020 and 2021 have been the first years of being unable to compete in the Vex robotics competition (due to age). 
                                Because of this I was able to put my full effort into mentoring teams and promoting robotics. During the 
                                university year I can mentor teams in Palmerston North, most notably, Palmerston North Girls' High 
                                School and St. Peters. To promote robotics in the region, I assist in running events, help teams and most 
                                importantly talk to local parents and teachers in attendance. This mentoring also extended to teams in the
                                Bay of Plenty region when home from university. I was also able to mentor teams in 2019, along with my own 
                                club in years prior as the club leader.
